			<![CDATA[<p>The Hertz name is synonymous with quality. But building a strong, successful brand and business did not happen overnight or by chance. It is the result of calculated action taken from effective planning.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We did not start the equipment rental business with the idea of awarding franchises. The reason we developed the idea of franchising is because of our ability to replicate our operations. For a select few franchisees, we are offering to share our system and increase our overall market share.</p>
