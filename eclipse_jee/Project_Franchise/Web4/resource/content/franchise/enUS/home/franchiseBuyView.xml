			<![CDATA[<p>Buying a Hertz Equipment Rental franchise is a true commitment. It involves dedication, time, money, and most importantly, it involves people and building relationships. Given our focus on customer service, hiring effective and high achieving people is one of the most important aspects of our business. </p>
			<p>&nbsp</p>
			<p>The customer experience drives our success and our people are the ones tasked with delivering that experience to our customers. We know how to turn casual, one-time renters into loyal, long-time customers. As a franchise partner, we will share that knowledge with you and your team. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It’s also important to note that working in the equipment rental business is not for everyone, as it does require dedication and effort. This is not a “hands-off” investment by any means; it requires constant attention to achieve your goals. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>However, you are not in this alone! Hertz Equipment Rental’s four-plus decades of experience and insight create the ideal platform for you to grow your own business without having to start from scratch. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We are looking for individuals to join our team who bring a proven track record of past success, superior people & relationship skills, an entrepreneurial spirit and the desire to succeed! </p>
